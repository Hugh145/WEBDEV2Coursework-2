                Our vison is to create a sustainable network of pantries providing low-cost food and wrap around services. 
                The pantry is a dignified approach empowering communities to help themselves. 
                The Pantry will support upskilling the community through volunteering and employability opportunities, 
                with the shop itself being utilised as a training facility.</p>

                The Scottish Pantry Network will support the pantries by being the collective voice for change,
                we forge strong partnerships to support the development of the hub model, creating a tailored
                experience for local communities.  The Network will provide ongoing support to the pantries through
